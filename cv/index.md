### Work History

Currently working as a Java software developer creating casino games for online markets. I work within a small team to scope, design, produce, and maintain software solutions to game concepts. The role often requires moving between and managing multiple projects while keeping to a high standard of clean and maintainable code. All projects involve extensively working with third parties to make effective use of their SDKs and platforms.

This was a temporary position which lasted for approximately three weeks. I worked with other testers to find faults in a large software project before its release. The role involved working with the software teams to decide relevant tests and report results.
