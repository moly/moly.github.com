## Description

Downbeat was created as a group project in the third year of my studies at the University of Abertay. The concept behind the game was a rhythm/platform hybrid, inspired by games such as [Vib-Ribbon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vib-Ribbon) and [Audiosurf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiosurf). Set in a dystopian future where all music has been outlawed by the government, the game tasks the player with collecting the few remaining instruments left in order to bring music back to the world.

I was responsible for various different parts of the project thoughout the development process. I was initally tasked with working with our artist to ensure that their assets would work with XNA's content pipeline, and would display properly in game. Later, I helped a fellow programmer who was working on the level generation. It was originally planned that the game would be able to create levels itself by analysing music tracks, allowing the player to use songs from their own library. Unfortunately, due to XNA's very limited audio interface and a general lack of time, we decided we had to set the levels manually.
