h2. Description

Warp is a short puzzle/platform game in which the player must reach the end of each level by "warping" between the edges of the game world. The game starts fairly simply, but switches, enemies, and power-ups are gradually introduced in later levels in order to provide more of a challenge.

Warp was "originally created in GameMaker":http://www.yoyogames.com/games/140947-warp, and I was commissioned by the authors to write a Flash version. It uses the opensource game framework flixel, which allowed me to complete the project in just under a month.

Press 'm' to unmute the game.
