h2. Description

flixel-android is an attempt to create a native Java/Android port of the popular 2d game making library "flixel":http://flixel.org. It is an opensource project and is currently being worked on by myself and another fellow contributor. We are building flixel-android on top of the powerful "libgdx":http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/ framework which will allow apps to also be deployed to Windows, Mac and Linux. The project is still very much a work in a progress, an apk demonstrating the current features is available "here":flixel-examples-android.apk.
